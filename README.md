# Computer-Graphics-Algorithms
Implementation of core Computer Graphics algorithms in C using OpenGL, including line clipping, fractals, curve drawing, and transformations. 

This project showcases implementations of key Computer Graphics algorithms using OpenGL and C.

- Line clipping (Cohen-Sutherland)
- Line drawing (Bresenham)
- Fractal generation (Koch curve)
- Curve plotting (Bezier curve)
- 2D transformations (translate, rotate, scale, shear)
  

Each program demonstrates the practical application of a specific algorithm in rendering graphics using OpenGL's basic primitives and interactive input.
